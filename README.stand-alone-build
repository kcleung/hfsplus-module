To build, do:

make -C /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/build/ M=`pwd`

To use, copy over, and run "depmod -a"

This is only tested for around kernel 3.0.

The "patches" directory contains all the patches applied.

The "patches-not-used" directory contains one patch which is
not applied, but to undo some stylistic changes from Naohiro
so that patch #2 with that patch gives the same git --numstat .
